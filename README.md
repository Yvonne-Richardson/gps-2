# Gardeners Planting System 2.0

This is the second edition of the Gardener's Planting System. It was written in 2021, and is an upgrade from the Gardener's Planting System that is located at https://github.com/Yvonne-Richardson/gps-1. 

It was easier to make a separate GitHub site than it was to update the first edition, so this one is located at https://github.com/Yvonne-Richardson/gps-2.

## What's New

This edition replaces the previous flat file data system with a MySQL database that contains the same information. All of the .csv files from the previous edition have been removed.

The page colors that indicate page sizes and orientations have been updated

Ferns, grains, mosses, and weeds have been added to the plant classifications.

Many of the plant images are the same, but the image naming system has been updated to make it easier to retrieve and classify the images according to the life stage of the plant.

More plants have been added to the database, and more information has been included about most of the plants. More information will be added to the database as time allows.

## New Pages

- A FAQ page was added to answer basic questions about plants and about the Web site.

- A Site Credits page was added. It includes links to locations where data and images were retrieved from the Internet for this site, in keeping with Educational Fair Use laws, the Wikipedia Commons, and similar shareable sites.
