<h3>by Yvonne V. Richardson</h3>
<p>The GPS web site provides information to the average gardener about plants that they might be interested in growing.  </p>
<p>On the Home page, the user selects from the nav bar, and a column of information is displayed.   When they select an item from that column, it is highlighted, and then they can choose 1 of 3 pages based on that column selection.  There is a button that is displayed when they make their selection, or they can choose from the pages in the nav bar.
</p>
<p>For example, I can choose flowers from the first page, and then select "petunia" from the list. From there I can ask what petunias look like(life stages), what to plant them with (companions), or just more stuff about petunias("more about" button).</p>
<p>The web page is responsive, but could be fine-tuned a little more to reduce jumpiness as the user changes screen sizes. The footer that always stays on the page occasionally obscures some text, which is a reminder that they may need to scroll to read the content (in addition to respecting the copyright).</p>
<p>The Gardener's Planting System is above and beyond what we are required to do for our final project. For the college, most of the pages were populated from data in several files; this version uses a database that is hosted on the server.  Some of the file entries are not completely filled out; for example, if there are no additional comments on a file entry, then the Comment field is blank. Likewise, if photographs have not yet been located for a plant, the "under construction" image is used instead.</p>
<p>Because the Website uses Javascript and PHP in addition to HTML and CSS, some pages are generated in addition to the static pages in the root directory.  These languages are used to send information between pages, so that the user can select an item on the first page and get detailed information of various types on the other pages.
If they navigate to a page without selecting a plant first, the site displays a reminder that they should select a plant.</p>
<h4>Class Requirements</h4>
<p> Each page uses main.css for common styling, and also has its own .css file for styling that is specific to that page. Much of the responsive programming is based on screen percentages, although there are media queries that are specific to each page.</p>
<ul>
<li>The pages on the web site are as follows:
<ul>
<li>Home (index.html, selectdb.php)</li>
<li>More About...Plants (dbdetails.php)</li>
<li>Companions (compdetails.php) </li>
<li>Life Stages (stagedetails.php) </li>
<li>Frequently Asked Questions (faq.php)</li>
<li>About (About.php)</li>
<li>Site Credits (sitecredits.php)</li>
<li>Contact Us! contact.html</li>
</ul><br>
  </li>

</ul>
<p>The web site uses a consistent navigation scheme by using the main navigation bar on every page, including the home page. No default fonts are used in the site, and there are alt tags for all images.</p>  
<h4>User Input</h4>
<p>The user input form contains </p>
<ol>
<li>Name field</li>
<li>Comment field</li>
<li>e-mail field</li>
<li>Submit and clear buttons</li>
</ol>
<h4>Meta Tags and Accessibility</h4>
<p>Meta tags for keywords and descriptions are added to Web pages, because search engines are so much more adept at finding web sites.  There are also alt-tags for every image.</p>
<h4>Design Principles</h4>
<p>I rely on the design principles of <strong><i>Proximity</i></strong>, <strong><i>Alignment</i></strong>, <strong><i>Repetition</i></strong>, and <strong><i>Contrast</i></strong> to make the page flow together, regardless of size. </p>
<p>One factor in deciding the  overall design was  that the web-page will be content-heavy, therefore the images and the responsiveness should not overshadow the textual content that is the reason for the site's existence.</p>
<p>Another factor is to allow for expansion.  The number of pages will always be the same, but the amount of data in the database will change. </p>
<p>A third factor is reasonableness in responsiveness.  People are still accustomed to web pages that may not quite fit the device they have.  When items do not display perfectly, the average user will still consider them to be readable.</p>
<br>
<p>Other principles used in creating the web page are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Balance
	<p>The pages are nicely balanced, and the text flows in to fill in the space. The pages that display information repeat the same two-in-a-box format that is easy to populate from the javascript and php behind the pages. The home page sequence is a little unbalanced when it displays a list from which to select, but the box is the same size as the pages that occur before and after, so the list format is not as noticeable. The alignment depends on whether there is text to display, so some of it aligns better at some screen sizes than others.</p></li>
<li>Grid
	<p>I used grids to line up content on secondary pages.  I did not use a spreadsheet-type grid because the web site does not display enough information on any page to make good use of the grid.</p></li>
<li>Color
	<p>The colors for backgrounds and text were sampled from the image that is in the main header and on the contact page.  This adds to the sense of harmony to the site. </p></li>
<li>Graphics
	<p>I kept graphics to a minimum so that users would concentrate on language content, or images of the plants.</p></li>
<li>Typography
	<p>I kept the number of fonts to a minimum and selected some favorite serif fonts that are somewhat reminiscent of the Farmers Almanac.  The contrast is good without being glaring.</p></li>
<li>White space
	<p>The backgrounds for language content are white for easy reading. The areas are properly padded to give the make the text stand out and invite the user to read a little longer.</p></li>
<li>Connection<p>The user should feel that they can read as long as they need to, and they will probably experiment with the Web page design a little. </p></li>
